# Postman Clone

This project is a group final assignment for the React 2025 course at app.rs.school.

## ‚ú® Project Overview

Postman is a comprehensive API development ecosystem that empowers users to consume, design, test, and manage APIs efficiently. More than just a testing tool, it provides end-to-end solutions for the entire API lifecycle.

- The platform provides tools to  construct and dispatch API requests
- Generate client code in 30+ languages (Python, JavaScript, cURL, etc.).
- Dynamic values stored as environment variables (e.g., {{base_url}}) can be reused throughout requests
- Auto-saves recent requests (filterable by date/method).
- Re-run past calls with one click.

## ‚ú® Technical Specifications

 1. Frontend Framework: React 19 and NextJS
 2. Design: SASS
 3. Multilingual Support: User interface available in Russian, English, Georgian, German and Polish. 
 4. Responsive Design: Optimized for various device sizes

## ‚ú® Technical Details

- Libraries and Frameworks
   In addition to React, the following libraries and frameworks were used:
   - Next: Make calls to the endpoint through the server.
   - Redux: For state management, ensuring a predictable and consistent state throughout the application.
   - HTTP Snippet: Snippet generator for languages (cURL, Javascript, Node, Java, Python, C#, Go)
   - Internationalization for Next.js: Offer content in multiple languages(Russian, English, Georgian, German and Polish)

- State Management
  The application uses Redux for managing the global state, making use of reducers, actions, and selectors to handle complex state transitions in a predictable manner.

- Testing Methods
The application was tested using both manual testing and automated tests:
   - Manual Testing: Conducted by the team to verify the user interface, interactions, and overall functionality of the application.
   - Automated Tests: Created using Jest to ensure the correct functionality of individual components and services. These tests cover unit testing for functions, components, and services to verify their behavior under different scenarios.

## ‚ú® Description of function blocks

### üíª Main page
- **For unauthorized users**, the page includes a link to the authentication page (`Sign In / Sign Up`).  
- **For authorized users**, the page provides navigation to the **RESTful client** and **History** routes.  

### üîê Sign In / Sign Up
- **After Successful Login**: The user is automatically redirected to the **Main page**.    
- **Already Logged In**: Any attempts to access auth routes (`/login`, `/signup`) the user is redirected to the **Main page**.

### üåê RESTful client
- Provides an easy way to construct and make different requests
- Produces ready-to-use code snippets for requests 
- Displays the HTTP response code and its associated status message.

### üìì Variables
- Supports variable substitution in URLs, bodies, and headers.

### üìú History
- Section restores complete request configurations for reuse, including HTTP method, URL, body content and header values.
- The History section displays requests in chronological order based on execution time.

## ‚ú® Conclusion

  - Key Takeaways and Skills Acquired

    Working together on this project was a highly rewarding experience that brought out the best in our team's collaboration and technical abilities. Through building the application with React, Next.js and Redux, we gained valuable hands-on experience with modern frontend development while learning to work together effectively. Our use of GitHub for version control and Discord for daily communication created an efficient workflow that allowed us to share knowledge and solve problems quickly. The project helped us grow in multiple ways - from mastering complex technical concepts like server-side rendering and state management to developing softer skills like giving constructive feedback and explaining technical decisions. We learned how to integrate different components smoothly, debug challenging issues together, and maintain good code quality standards.
